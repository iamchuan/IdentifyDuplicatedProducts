# Identify Duplicated Products

The original idea of this project came from **rcuevass**'s work, [Text Analysis and Entity Resolution](https://github.com/rcuevass/Spark_PySpark_Machine_Learning/blob/master/02-Text-Analysis-Entity-Resolution/Text%20analysis%20and%20entity%20resolution%20-%20Spark%20-%20PySpark.ipynb). In his lab, he was trying to predict the duplicated products from Amazon and Google Store purely based on Spark RDD. 

In this repo, we revisited the same problem using Spark machine learning library (TF-IDF, Decison Tree, Pipeline, etc.) and the mix of Spark dataframe and Spark RDD. We also applied Downsampling and Emsemble to deal with the imbalanced data.
